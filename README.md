For this project, I was tasked with designing a simple landing page for a new product.

The following were some of the key instructions for the task:

-Research best practices for landing pages, focusing on CTA
(Call to Action) placement, colour schemes, and content layout.

-Develop wireframes and high-fidelity designs for the landing page.
-Incorporate elements like hero images, testimonials, and
product features to optimize for conversions.


My Approach :
To begin the design process, I first decided on the product. 
I chose to create a landing page for a pair of hi-fi wireless headphones. 
These headphones are sold by Nirvana Music Store, an online platform that specializes in music and audio products, offering customers extraordinary listening experiences. 
As headphones are the store's primary product, they became the focus of this project.
Feel free to explore the overall project!

As a bonus, I decided to add an actual webpage for my product. Upon loading this webpage, the landing page made using HTML & CSS would show.
