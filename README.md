For this project , I was tasked with designing a simple landing page for a new product.

The following were some of the key instruction for the task:
-Research best practices for landing pages, focusing on CTA
(Call to Action) placement, color schemes, and content layout.
-Develop wireframes and high-fidelity designs for the landing page.
-Incorporate elements like hero images, testimonials, and
product features to optimize for conversions.

As a bonus, I decided to add an actual webpage for my product. Upon loading this webpage, the landing page made using basic HTML, CSS & JavaScript would show.
